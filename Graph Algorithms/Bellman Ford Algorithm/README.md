# Bellman Ford Algorithm
It is a single source shortest path algorithm __that can operate on negatively weighted graphs__ as well (Dijkstra Algorithm may or may not work for negatively weighted graphs)
### Drawback
Does not work if the graph contains a negative weight cycle <br>
### Time Complexity
O(V.E)
 > V - vertices <br>
 > E - edges <br>
