# Data Structures and Algorithms
All the assignments and coursework done as a part of Coursera DSA course by Princeton University. Also, this repository contains the implementation of various data structures and various algorithms. This repository can be the one go-to resource for various technical interviews and even for getting a shorthand implementation of algos during your CP contest.ðŸ˜‰
